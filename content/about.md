The 4-H Youth Development Program is in every county in California. 4-H is a an organization where young people, 5–19, are given opportunities to build confidence, learn responsibility, and develop skills that will last them a lifetime. It’s an organization where youth make friends and share interests, ranging from building robots to raising rabbits, designing web pages to landscape design. 4-H is where youth work together to make a positive difference in their community, and adult volunteers make a powerful difference in the lives of young people. Get involved in the 4-H community and make a lasting difference!

4-H is the nation’s largest youth development and empowerment organization with over 90,000 clubs nationwide. The name represents the four personal development areas of:
* Head — Managing, Thinking
* Heart — Relating, Caring
* Hands — Giving, Working
* Health — Being, Living

Though historically an agriculturally focused organization, 4-H’ers today engage in hands-on learning in the areas of citizenship, healthy living, food security, science, engineering, technology, and more. 4-H continues to develop new projects for its members to study beyond agriculture and animal husbandry, including photography, environmental-stewardship, cooking, urban gardening, and beekeeping.
