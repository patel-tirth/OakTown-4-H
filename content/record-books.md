The 4-H program has a long history of record keeping. This focus reflects the importance of this life skill in our daily lives. In 4-H, young people track their activities, events, profits and losses, skill development and learning experiences.Completing a 4-H Record Book is a process where 4-H members record project and club work.

4-H Record Books serve a variety of purposes:
* 4-H Record Books encourage members to set goals, pursue strategies to meet those goals, and to shift gears in the face of challenges and obstacles. 
* Completing a 4-H Record Book is a requirement for running for the higher officer positions. 
* A 4-H Record Book may be required to receive participation awards (such as star ranking, medals or pins based on 4-H Record Book achievements).
* **The 4-H Record Book is not required for 4-H membership or for participation in 4-H activities such as club events and activities, or for attending 4-H camps or conferences.**
* Paper version, official manual, and sample record books are available from the [California 4-H Record Book Training and Resources page.](http://4h.ucanr.edu/Resources/Member_Resources/RecordBook/)
