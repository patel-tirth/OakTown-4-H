The goal of 4-H is to develop citizenship, leadership, responsibility and life skills in youth through experiential learning programs and a positive youth development approach. We strive to engage youth to reach their full potential, working and learning with caring adults. The 4-H motto is “To make the best better”, while its slogan is “Learn by doing”. A recent report from Tufts University shows that 4-H youth excel beyond their peers. 4-H’ers are about:

* Four times more likely to make contributions to their communities (Grades 7–12)
* Two times more likely to be civic minded and active (Grades 8–12)
* Two times more likely to make healthier choices (Grade 7)
* Two times more likely to participate in Science, Engineering and Computer Technology programs during out-of-school time (Grades 10–12) and
* 4-H girls are two times more likely (Grade 10) and nearly three times more likely (Grade 12) to take part in science programs compared to girls in other out-of-school time activities.
